# How To Start Growing Code

disclaimer: this is a new project we are taking on. nobody is a pro but nobody is a noob so if you have ideas on how to improve any of this, LETS DO IT.

**how do you get started coding**

## **1. Choose a project you're interested in [here](https://github.com/orgs/sfsuacm-space/repositories).**
Start by exploring projects that align with your interests or technologies you want to improve in. Look through the project’s README, documentation, and contribution guidelines. This helps you pick a project where your work will be useful and supported.

## 2. **Find an issue or feature** you’d like to work on.
Navigate to the project's issue tracker and look for problems labeled as “good first issue,” “help wanted,” or ones that match your skill level. Read through the discussion to ensure no one else is currently working on it. If needed, leave a quick comment expressing your intention to take on the issue.

Sometimes issues are labeled as “good first issues”. This is your hint to try it out :)))

## **3. Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.

Click the **Fork** button in the project’s GitHub repo to create your own copy. This fork acts as your personal workspace, letting you freely make changes without affecting the original repository. Once forked, you’ll have full control to experiment and build your solution.

## **4. Implement your changes**, *committing as you go*.

Start developing your fix or feature. Follow the project’s coding style and run tests if they exist. Make frequent, meaningful commits with clear messages so your progress is easy to follow. This also helps maintainers understand your thought process during review.

## 5. Open a Pull Request to the main repository

Go to the original project’s repository and open a new Pull Request (PR) from your branch. Provide a clear summary of what you did, why you did it, and how to test it. Link the issue you’re resolving so maintainers can track it. 

After submitting, engage in any feedback discussions to refine your contribution until it’s ready to merge.

## 6. Respond to feedback and iterate.

Once your PR is submitted, maintainers or other contributors may leave comments, request changes, or suggest improvements. Review the feedback carefully, make the necessary updates in your branch, and push them to the same branch. 

This process may repeat a few times until the PR is approved and merged. Engaging constructively here not only helps get your contribution merged but also serves as a key learning opportunity for you.

And like that… you are now a planter. good job and happy growing
