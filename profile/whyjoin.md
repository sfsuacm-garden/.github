# why join (a brief mini-rant from a fellow mad gardener)
    
I spit the worst, most generic, overused, vague advice that all computer science students hate when it comes to building your resume, CS skills, and getting more involved: 
    
'build a personal project’.
    
While it's true that building a personal project can be a solid learning opportunity, only hearing this one piece of advice creates two issues: 
    
1. It doesn't speak to most undergraduate computer science/computer science-adjacent students who are still learning what's possible with software, and
2.  it frames the software engineering process as an isolating, lonely journey. 
    
As a result, students end up building projects with limited imagination and little outside perspective. And yes, I'm included in that. Just check out [my dead repo](https://github.com/oderanwosu/greem-api).
    
But I want to change the advice.

It's not a new idea, but it's one SFSU students deserve to have here. The change is not with vibe-coded projects that value results over maintainability (s/o to my vibe coders ❤️), but with a community where students can be **inspired by their peers**, **learn and grow their skills** with the help of others, f**ocus on process over results**, and **contribute to meaningful projects that positively impact people**.

A community garden where we *grow* skills and software. 

It will require some vulnerability to 'share your work with class' and have your code reviewed. A little patience with contributors working at different skill levels and reviewers with busy lives who might take time to accept your code (I am the reviewer—vv sorry in advance). And lastly, some trust that advice is being given in good faith and with encouragement.

In the end, you're contributing to something bigger than yourself while also growing yourself. You get hands-on experience with the full support of those around you; That's what makes it worth it.

So join us, because growing with others is more fun than doing it alone. 🌱

Sincerely,
Odera N.
